	<h3>This is me.</h3>
	<p>Pies. Tons and tons of pies. I'm not exactly a foodie, but having my fingers in a load of pies effectively describes me best. I try doing justice to every project I take up: This might just be over-optimism here, but I haven't dropped the ball (or pie) on any yet. Frankly, I've had a higher success rate of 'pulling out the plum' than most, so I guess my pies have a healthy dose of luck too.
	<br><br>Gee, I'm hungry now.</p>

		Stuff I'm good at
	</h3>
	<p>Web tech is something I'm generally inclined towards. That aside, I'm skilled at content strategy and social media, up-to-date with SEO technologies, experienced with typography and colour matching (which, IMHO, goes a long way in making websites look absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>), and very decent when it comes to graphic design and editing.
